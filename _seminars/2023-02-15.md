title:      "Fostering Human-Machine Understanding through Education & Design"

location:   "Zoom"

abstract: |
  My research explores how to foster human-machine understanding through several different approaches, which I will present in this talk. I will discuss my overarching research agenda, which is shaped by 1) designing learning experiences about technology in social, embodied contexts; 2) developing systems that afford human-machine communication and foster learning through interaction; and 3) creating interactive public art and performances to imagine and rethink modes of human-machine interaction. Several design themes guide my work, including using embodied interaction, collaboration, and creative exploration to reduce intimidation and foster curiosity and learning. I will discuss in-depth my research on defining AI literacy and my iterative design research process, which resulted in several activities for informal learning spaces that foster family learning about AI. My talk will conclude with directions for future work on how education and design can be leveraged to create more creative, equitable, and understandable AI in our everyday lives.

bio: |
  Dr. Duri Long is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Northwestern University. She is a human-centered AI researcher interested in issues surrounding AI literacy and human-AI interaction. Duri's research looks at how humans interact and learn as a way of informing the design of public AI literacy interventions as well as the development of AI that can interact naturally and improvise creatively with people in complex social environments. She employs a variety of methodologies and theoretical frameworks in her research, drawing on the learning sciences, design research, and cognitive science. She has experience working with artists and museums around the country to develop co-creative, embodied exhibits and art installations involving AI and technology. Duri holds a PhD in Human Centered Computing from Georgia Tech and degrees in Computer Science and Dramatic Art from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
