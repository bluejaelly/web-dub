title:      "Autistic Youth, Mental Health, and the Sociotechnical Shaping of Sociality"

location:   "CSE2/Gates 401 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  With more possibilities than ever for media and technology use anytime and anywhere, young people’s online and offline worlds are shaping one another in complex ways. This is especially true among children, adolescents, and teens on the autism spectrum, who may discover unique opportunities for socializing, communicating, and expressing themselves through digital media, as well as encounter specific threats to their safety and privacy. These challenges can be compounded by heightened risks of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and other co-occurring mental health conditions. This talk, based on Alper’s recent book, Kids Across the Spectrums: Growing Up Autistic in the Digital Age (MIT Press, 2023), focuses on the prospects of media and technology for positively and negatively impacting the mental well-being of autistic youth, with a particular emphasis on their identity, emotional, and social development, drawing on ethnographic research that centers their personal stories. Their experiences with digital media also highlight what Alper terms the “sociotechnical shaping of sociality,” or how the relationship between society and technology shapes and is shaped by neurotypical interpersonal expectations.

  This seminar is co-organized with [UW CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/).

  #### Schedule 
  
  11:45am - 12:15pm: Food and community socializing.

  12:15pm - 1:15: Presentation with Q&A.  Available hybrid via Zoom.

  1:15pm - 2:00pm: Student meeting with speaker, held in CSE2/Gates 371.
