title:      "Designing Intelligent Human-Centered Technologies for Health and Wellness"

location:   "Kane 225 - Hybrid via Zoom"
# location:   "CSE2/Gates 401 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  Computing holds the promise of alleviating the negative impact of chronic disease and mental health disorders by scaling human effort over time and space. Four in ten adults in the US have two or more chronic illnesses, and one in five adults experiences a mental illness. The urgent need to improve chronic care calls for robust and reliable technology that is readily available to integrate into care-ecologies. In this talk, I will demonstrate how human-centered computing can leverage the generalizability of theoretical frameworks to build systems for asthma, PTSD, and diabetes. I will discuss the unique challenges in their context of care: for patients with asthma and diabetes including poor patient engagement and lack of continuity of care, while PTSD therapy is limited by over-reliance on patient self-reports and clinician intuition. I will present theory-driven technology interventions that address these issues and describe how AI could transform patient care and expedite clinician training. I will also discuss how ecological computing systems can lead to improved health and wellness in diverse populations. 

bio: |
  Dr. Arriaga is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher in the School of Interactive Computing. Her current research is in mental health and chronic care management. She designs technology to increase patient engagement, support continuity of care, enhance clinical decision making and mediate patient-provider communication.  She has received NSF awards to develop computational systems to improve PTSD treatment and recovery (NSF Smart & Connected Health), and to incorporate AI into the clinical work-force (NSF Future of Work). She is also funded by the American Diabetes Association to create a diabetic foot ulcer care system.
 
  She earned a Ph.D. in Psychology from Harvard University and has been at GT since 2007. From 2019 to 2022 she was the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies in Interactive Computing. She has graduated 8 PhD students and advised numerous MS and undergraduate students. Her User Experience Design MOOC for the Georgia Tech-Coursera partnership has been completed by over 40k learners (with 4.5/5-star rating) and was cited as one of the top 250 online courses of all time.
