title:      "Patriarchy and Health: Designing Technologies for Men to Improve Women’s Health in Pakistan"

location:   "CSE2/Gates 401 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  This talk will address the design challenges and opportunities in creating health technologies for men to improve the health of women in religiously conservative, patriarchal, and low-income societies. In this talk, I will share findings from the deployment of a speech-based service called Super Abbu (Super Dad) designed to connect expectant fathers to doctors and to each other. Over a period of 71 days, the service reached upwards of 20,000 users who spent almost 400 thousand minutes on the platform. Through a critical examination of cultural and societal factors, such as traditional gender roles, stigma towards sexual health information-seeking, and limited access to resources, I will highlight key considerations for designing effective and culturally sensitive health technologies for this population. The goal of this talk is to provide insights and recommendations for designers, researchers, and practitioners to create health technologies that are inclusive, accessible, and effective for users, regardless of their cultural, social, and economic backgrounds.
  
  This seminar is co-organized with [UW Change](https://change.washington.edu/).

  In-person food will be available at 11:45 PM, Zoom will open at 12:00 PM, the talk will start at 12:15 PM.
